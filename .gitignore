# NOTE: You cannot git-ignore an individual setting line inside a tracked file
# (for example DEVELOPMENT_TEAM inside project.pbxproj). To avoid committing
# a development team value in the tracked project file consider one of:
#  - Move team-specific settings into a local xcconfig that is ignored
#  - Remove the DEVELOPMENT_TEAM from the project and let it be set per-user
#  - Use a pre-commit hook or a custom merge/clean filter to scrub the field
